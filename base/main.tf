/**

 * This module is a base module to provision shared resources that will be used
 * when scheduling ECS tasks. This base module is intended to be used with
 * ecs-task-scheduler/scheduled-task. The scheduled-task companion module could
 * be used multiple times in a single terraform environment but it does not make
 * provision generic resources like the lambda function and it's IAM role and
 * policies multiple times. Instead they are created by this module and can then
 * be passed on to scheduled-task modules.
